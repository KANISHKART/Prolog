AND = ,
OR = ;
IF = :-


ATOMS Type 1

    Strictly letters+numbers

ATOM Type 2

    Strictly special characters

If something is declared in single quotes then it's an atom:

    For ex: '230uec' is an atom but if we remove that it's not an atom.

Constants in prolog starts with a Uppercase or underscore

    ex: Hell, _name

Anonymous variable (Variable wont be assigned)

    ex: _

Cannot intialize two atoms to a variable


Relational :

Equal               : X=:=Y
Not Equal           : X\=Y
less than           : X < Y
greater than        : X > Y
less than eq        : X =< Y (different way)
greater thann eq    : X >= Y


Logic:

2 plus 3        : X is 2+3
2 minus 3       : X is 2-3
2 multiply 3    : X is 2*3
2 divivde 3     : X is 2/3 (quotient)
2 divide 3      : X is 2//3 (int quotient)
2 mode 3        : X is 10 mod 2(reminder)


lists:

[X,Y,Z]=[1,2,3] means X=1, Y=2,Z=3

[X|Y] means X is head and rest all is tail.


In approaching a problem always first write the break statement first and just loop through to reach the break statement and then do any operation.


findNum(X,[X|_]).
findNum(X,[_|T]):- findNum(X,T).


size([],0).
size([H|T], N):- size(T,N1) , N is N1+1.


sum([],0).
sum([H|T], R):- sum(T, N1), R is H+N1.
